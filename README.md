# Hi, I'm Vesta 👋

### 🐍 Python Software Engineer
I am a **Systems-focused Python Engineer** with a background in building scalable infrastructure for computational workloads. I focus on **ModelOps**, seeking to bridge the gap between data science and production-grade software engineering. Academically, I currently explore **Continual Learning** and **Malware Detection**.

## 🏆 [Application of Continual Learning for Deep Neural Network–Based Malware Classification](https://github.com/vestacic/continual-learning-malware-classification)

* **The Challenge:** Malware continuously evolves, making traditional signature-based detection insufficient. While Deep Neural Networks provide good generalization, they suffer from **Catastrophic Forgetting**— losing knowledge of old threats when learning new ones.
* **The Solution:** I explored **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)** as a regularization strategy to preserve critical network parameters.
* **Implementation** My research focused on the approximation of the **Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)**. I analyzed the trade-offs between:
    * **True Fisher Information Matrix**,
    * **Empirical Fisher Matrix**.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch.

## 🚀 Professional Focus: ModelOps Infrastructure
I treat models as **payloads** and focus on building the **rocket** that carries them.

* **Backend Architecture:** Designing and implementing high-availability microservices using **FastAPI** and **Flask**, focusing on low-latency request handling and system reliability.
* **Microservices Architecture:** Designing and maintaining the backend services that handle model platform orchestration.
* **Integration Tooling:** Developing internal Python packages that standardize how models are integrated into the platform.
